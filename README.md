- The objective of this assignment is to create a research proposal with a stated research question, a proper literature review, and an identification of data sources.
- The R script file to run is **final_assign2_ottschneider.Rmd**
- You then can knit to a pdf (the default setting), which is already saved in our repository.
- This pdf (final_assign2_ottschneider.pdf) serves as our submission for our research proposal.
- Our working title is *Do Notch Resuscitate: The Inheritance Tax in Germany, Pre- and Post-Notched Taxation*
- You will also see our two working .bib files serving as our references for documents (main1.bib) and software (packages1.bib)
- Furthermore, we have create a Figures folder, which contains the figures used in the creation of our research proposal.
