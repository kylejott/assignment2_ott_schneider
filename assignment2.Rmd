# Explanation

I gathered data from @Pemstein2010 on countries' democracy level. They call their
democracy measure the Unified Democracy Score (UDS). I also gathered data from
the @WorldBank2013 on fertilizer consumption.[^units] Figure 1 shows the mean
UDS scores over time for all of the countries in their sample plotted against
the natural logarithm of their fertilizer consumption. Also, Foer shows that we can
train and win at the world memory championships if we follow a simple method @moonwalking.

# The Plot

The following is a plot. It was created using the R [@CiteR] ggplot2 [@R-ggplot2].

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap='Mean UDS Scores vs. Fertilizer Consumption'}
# Run source code to create scatter plot
source("Analysis/ScatterUDS_Fert.R")
```


[^units]: The data is in kilograms per hectare of arable land.
